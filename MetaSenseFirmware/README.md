# METASENSE Ari Quality Node Firmware
The firmware works with particle photon (http://particle.io) and the custom hardware designed by UCSD MetaSense team (http://metasense.ucsd.edu).
This version of the firmware has been modified to compute part of the herarhcical NN and communicate with the rest of the smarthome.

To use the code compile and upload it to your photon using Particle CLI tools.
